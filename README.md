An unofficial book based on the course mastering python by elzero.org https://elzero.org/category/courses/mastering-python/  
  
I made the book to serve as a comprehensive reminder of the content covered in the course "Mastering Python". This book was created to be a helpful resource
for me to review and reinforce the concepts learned during the course, and I hope that it will also be a valuable resource for others who are interested
in learning Python.
